<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Dylan Jonas. I am an Interactive Multimedia Major going through his freshman year at The College of New Jersey. Animation has been a high interest of mine, but i haven't been able to start up anything with it until now. Reciving the tools I now have found in the Adobe Creative Suite, I use them to create animated shorts and to learn animation as a whole along the way. I'm starting with 2D animation in Adobe Flash to get the hang of things, but I don't want to stop there. 3D animation is what really grabs my attention, specifically modeling, sculpting, and rigging characters. I hope to one day use the skills I've learned over the years to make my own feature length films.</p>
