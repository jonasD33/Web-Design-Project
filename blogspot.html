    <h2>Entry 1: The Birth of a Website (2/5/18)</h2>
    <p>This week's been an interesting one. I've started up on constructing the very barebones examples for my website-to-be, not to mention how long of a road it'll be before its done. On the brightside, I've decided to upload a new video, so now I'll have something to post up to the site once I relearn how to post and connect up links. Ta-ta for now then!</p>
    
    <h2>Entry 2: Web Builiding - Decrypting a Conundrum of Links and the Like (2/11/18)</h2>
    <p>Hello again! I've returned once more, and I've made a little bit of progress since then. I had a little trouble before trying to get web links to work, but after some quick checking from the good old <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">site building tutorials</a> again, I've managed to hold a grasp onto setting up links to other websites. Now the next task is to figure out how to organize them properly (eventually these should be put into seperate linked categories, perhaps)! But in the meantime, I can finally start up what I've meant to do in the first place for this website. Being that this website is partially a portfolio site, I can now share links to show off what I've been working on from my Youtube channel!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIAZBAA3_ANvMf-1Pe8ABQ?view_as=subscriber">You can click here to see the channel</a> if you want to have a look for yourself. Well, that's all for now, I suppose. Until another post!</p>
    
    <h2> Entry 3: Alright, we got pictures!(3/6/18)</h2>
    <p> A little short post for today, but we've finally have an image on the website! YAY! This image down here will eventually be the [supposed] logo/home button for the website! Now, I just need to figure how to get it in the right spot...</p>
    
    <h2> Entry 4: Web Buliding - Launching a Protoype Website (3/18/18)</h2>
    <p> Hey there! Been a while, yes, but it's been spent (really in the course of a few mind boggling hours) putting together the basis of the website! ALl the primary pages and subpages should now be in order, now all that's left is to just put them <i>in</i> order and add some mactually ontent for any admirers to see. The journey never truly ends, and that's the beatuy of it.</p>
